This subdirectory tree contains all the files and python scripts required to train the a transformer (spacetimeformer) on the data by sonobat. It also has scripts for preprocessing and cleaning the data generating the files generated by Sonobat.

notebooks/ contains some jupyter notebooks where in the data is explored and played around with.
scripts/ contains scripts for running training and inference routines for the transformer.
data/ contains wrappers which expose the generated dataset to the pytorch APIs, as well as scripts for generating said dataset.

To start off, create a new conda environment, from the yaml file provided:
```conda create env -f env.yml```

Then, install the spacetimeformer module:
```cd spacetimeformer/ && pip install -e .```

Make sure you do 
```git submodule --init```
first.
